      <p><a href="https://github.com/michaeljthacker">Mike Thacker</a> is working on learning D3 for graphs and figures so that I might be able to use them at work for dynamic, interactive data visualizations. Depending how this page looks, it might be going well, or not. My 4-year-old is also helping with colors and transitions, so no credit to me for the awesome work there. You've got to get them interested in code somehow, right? Enjoy, folks!</p>
